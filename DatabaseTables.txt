Whether you are new to yoga or have a strong practice our classes are inclusive for all women. We provide a range of options within each posture to cater for all abilities and journeys. We respect your space and help you build your practice through a gentle yet thorough instruction.\r\n\r\nPhoebe has an in-depth knowledge of pregnancy and birth physiology, movement science and knows how to effortlessly incorporate the ancient wisdom of yoga practices such as breath awareness and modulation with this class to leave you feeling strong, resilient and totally relaxed. We use powerful neuroscientific evidence towards the practice of setting intention, positive visualisations and breath modulation that will enable you to combat your anxiety and stress of pregnancy, birth and motherhood and truly be able to enjoy your new- found space in the world of parenting.', 60, 5.00, 'yoga_image (7).jpg', ''),
(2001, 'Baby Yoga', 'Phoebe Freeman', 'Baby yoga is pretty much what it sounds like yoga with our babies. Its much gentler and slower compared to traditional yoga. A lot of the moves are adapted for, or to do with, babies. You dont need to know anything about yoga to take part in a baby yoga class you just need a baby! It can be a very relaxing experience for the two of you as doing gentle exercise, such as yoga, releases endorphins. These hormones encourage happiness and more love for your baby. This can help with bonding, which is particularly great for dads. Attending a class can also help you to meet like-minded parents in your area  something which can be difficult when youre a parent!\r\n\r\nIs it safe for my baby?\r\nOf course! If you attend a registered class your teacher should have the appropriate qualifications. Most or all of the moves used within a baby yoga class have been adapted for a baby, so theyre not vigorous or dangerous at all.', 45, 4.50, 'yoga_image (8).jpg', ''),
(2003, 'Kids Yoga', 'Willow Brown', 'Children are innately flexible; they love to engage all their senses and explore freely with their mind and body. Willow\'s kids yoga class is specially designed to allow this exploration to occur. Each class aims to combine elements of stories, music, imagination and visualisation with traditional yoga techniques creating a unique movement experience. Classes integrate movement, sound and play as these elements have a profound impact on learning, creativity, stress management and improved health and wellbeing. Kids naturally do yoga. They begin from infancy, pushing up from their belly into cobra pose. They naturally lift their feet into the air into dead bug pose, or pull their feet to their mouth. Like adults, kids experience what it means to fuse their mind, body and breath and begin to benefit by building strength, flexibility and feeling great inside.\r\n\r\nYoga is not affiliated to any religion or belief system. It is a science; not a religious path. Yoga is for you, about you and in you the person experiencing a union of body, breath and mind.\r\n\r\nIn Willow\'s kids yoga class, they get to bend, stretch, balance, breathe, twist, and turn upside-down. They get to hear language like calm your mind, use your eyes to focus; look for your inner eye. They get to challenge themselves by seeing how long they can lie still for in savasana, or balance like a strong and powerful tree.', 45, 4.50, 'yoga_image (6).jpg', ''),
(2004, 'Beginners Yoga', 'Willow Brown', 'A welcoming practice to help you find the foundations of your flow. With clear direction and support, create space and strength in the body, enjoy new ease and clarity in the mind and establish a deep feeling of connection to your whole self.

All change flows from the first pebble cast. Start the ripples here.', 60, 5.00, 'yoga_image (3).jpg', ''),
(2007, 'Vinyasa Flow Yoga', 'Jasmine Johnson', 'Vinyasa is a style of yoga where poses are strung together to form one fluid sequence of movement. The classes are often fast-paced and rhythmical, with a focus on connecting the movements with the rhythm of the breath. Vinyasa means to move with the breath, which is essentially the core of a Vinyasa class. Often called flow yoga, Vinyasa Flow is a style of yoga with focus on transitions and movements, with less time spent in stationary poses.\r\n\r\nAlthough Vinyasa is often considered a fast and physically challenging practice, it can also be soft and gentle. Moving with the breath can also mean slowing down your transitions with deep inhales and slow exhalations.\r\n\r\nNo two classes are ever the same, and often the sequences are creative and playful.', 75, 5.50, 'yoga_image (9).jpg', ''),
(2008, 'Flow Heat Yoga', 'Jasmine Johnson', 'Enjoy the warmth of our heated studio at 31-33 degrees and feel its benefits helping you move deeper into the body and your flow. Heated classes offer challenge and release to strengthen and lengthen the muscles, cleanse the body and stoke your inner fire.\r\n\r\nBenefits of Hot Yoga\r\n\r\nCardiovascular health: Exercising in the heat increases your heart rate and makes the body work harder, so a hot yoga class will be a more strenuous for the body than a similar class done in a lower temperature.\r\n\r\nFlexibility: The heat in the room means you will have to create less heat yourself to feel your muscles loosen up. Youll be able to move deeper into stretches and wont have to warm up as much to build the heat.\r\n\r\nDetoxing: A lot of people will claim that because you sweat a lot in a yoga class, youre detoxing. This isnt exactly right. Your body doesnt detox through your skin, but rather through the kidney and liver, so a hot yoga class wont directly have you releasing toxins. However the cardiovascular exercise and the fact that you drink lots of water can help boost your metabolism, and essentially help you flush toxins.\r\n\r\nBreathing: Although the heat might mean that you feel like you are working hard to catch your breath in a yoga class, the breathing exercises that are often done in class can over time help increase your lung capacity and help you breathe better and deeper.', 60, 5.00, 'yoga_image (1).jpg', ''),

Release - lower back, hamstrings/quads, hips, chest shoulders and neck. Twists - to help free the middle spine and aid digestion.\r\n\r\nBreathing: Focused breath - (life force energy). Conscience breathing has a medatitive quality to it and helps sync breath to body, fantastic for stress levels, improving concentration to the moment and enhancing energy levels.\r\n\r\nCore training: To help strengthen and tone the abdominals and low back muscles. These exercises help support your body. Great for posture and relief of low back pain.\r\n\r\nDeep relaxation: Lying comfortably on a mat with warm supportive blankets welcoming your mind and body to rest. You can set a supportive intention for the next day or week. Great for reducing stress, relaxing the mind and releasing physical tension. Resting can help reduce anxiety, improve sleep and insomnia and enhance creativity. Discover a timeless, calm-space and an overall feeling of wellbeing.', 75, 5.50, 'yoga_image (2).jpg', ''),

It was a weekly activity my dad and I could do together in a time when many relationships start to struggle. Needless to say, our relationship has only grown deeper and our love of yoga has too. It continues to be something we do together twelve years later.\r\n\r\nWhen I went off to college I really started to practice and is in fact one of the hardest classes I took and my only C- I struggled learning all of the sanskrit! My practice became a constant in my life. This lead me to dive head first into a more full practice within the eight limbs of yoga.\r\n\r\nI am excited to be teaching others as I continue to expand my own learning and practice. During the week, I am a seventh and eighth grade science teacher. My husband Ryan and I, also welcomed Calvin into our lives in February 2016. Due to his arrival, I also began my path of Mummy Yoga.

Letting go of judgement, competition, and expectations. In 2016, I achieved:\r\n\r\n- YogaFit 200 hour certification\r\n\r\n- National Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT 200)\r\n\r\nI am a lifelong student and continue my yogic journey practising daily.
